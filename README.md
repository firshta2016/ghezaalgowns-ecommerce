I used React to create an e-commerce web app, below are some of the features I added.
   1. List of items dynamically rendered
   2. 'add to cart' feature, that enables the user to add items to the cart and continue shopping
   3. Used 'React Routing' that allows the user to navigate to 'item detail' page, 'cart' page and more.
   4. Implemented secure 'PayPal' checkout feature.
   5. Implemented Bootstrap
   6. Added styling and animations for a better user experience
