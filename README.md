I used React to create an e-commerce web app, below are some of the features I added.
   1. List of items dynamically rendered.
   2. 'add to cart' feature, that enables the user to add items to the cart and continue shopping.
   3. User is able to remove items from the cart and/or increase the quantity.
   4. Used 'React Routing' that allows the user to navigate to different pages without refreshing.
   5. Implemented secure 'PayPal' checkout feature.
   6. Implemented Bootstrap
   7. Added styling and animations for a better user experience
